# 3 - Collectables and Kills
## Player Page
Every player created gets a player page accessible from:

https://talesofyore.com/player.php?name=cokeandcode

The page shows all of the player's achievements, including collectables and kills. Collectables are in-game items and activities that can be completed. These are a large part of the game, and most players are aiming to get them all.

Kills are the different types of opponents you have beaten. There are two types of kills: regular and golden. Regular kills are recorded when you beat any opponent in game. Gold kills are rare monsters than spawn infrequently. Gold monsters tend to be stronger and drop more loot. It's is quite difficult to achieve a full set of gold kills.
## Quests
Throughout there game there are many quests. Each quest is recorded on your player page. There are two types of quests:

* General, or Free, quests are available to everyone and build up the core of the game and its story. Completing all of these will get you a 100% marker against "Free Quests".

* Patron quests are only available to people who support the game's development through Patreon. However, these quests are intentionally designed to be either cosmetic or fun. They do not impact the game in any way. There is no pay-to-win in Tales of Yore.
## Books
The world is filled with literature on the bookcases, shelfs and bedside tables scattered throughout Yore. Each book has a tiny bit of story or lore that builds up the game. In some cases, to be able to start a quest you must first have read about it.

The player page lists all the books that a player has found and read in the game.
## Epics
Epic items are purely-cosmetic items that cost a lot of in-game gold. They are designed to provide long-term players a way of disposing of their extra gold to get token items representing their achievements. Often, epic items have a visual representation on the player to allow them to show off their fancy equipment. It is extremely rare that an epic item will have especially good statistics compared to a regular version in game.

The player page lists all the epic items that a player has bought.
